# ezPrepare

This tool provides a web interface for renaming columns of a .csv file

The tool currently provides standardized column and unit names from ODM2, but could be expanded to include other standardized variables


## Accessing the program
Currently you have to download and run the code on your computer.
Eventually, we would like this to be available by going to a website

### Clone the repository 

#### Using the terminal
    git clone https://github.com/nwallin1/dataWrangler.git


### Start Web Server
The file that has the website code is ezPrepare/index.html

I use Visual Studio Code Liver Server to run my web server: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer


You can also follow Mozilla's documentation for starting a web server with python: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server
